Practical 7(yacc Compund simple)

`yyparse()-return a value of 0 if the input it parse is valid according to the given grammer values,yyparse call routine called yylex() everytime it wants to obtain a token from the input
`yylex()-return a values indicating the type of token that has been obtain 
`Algorithm-1.write the lex program which recognize nessary token extension 2.write yacc program with grammar for delarative statement 3.compile lex and yacc program to generate lex.yy.c and y.tab.c program
4.compile c program to generate the object program a.out
